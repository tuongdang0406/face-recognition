If values are valid, and the email does not exist, they are stored in a database, encrypting the password. If register fails, an error message is displayed.

Signin: validates and sanitizes inputs. Checks if user-password paid exists in database. If sign in succedes, the correspondinguser profile is displayed, else an arror message is displayed.

Face recognition: Once the profile is displayed, the user can enter the url of an image. If the image contains human faces, the user entries are incremented by the number of the recognized faces. In case the url is not valid, an error message is displayed. Face detection is done using Clarifai API.
